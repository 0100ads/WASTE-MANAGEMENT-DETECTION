## Introduction

Effective waste management is crucial for maintaining clean and sustainable environments. This project focuses on developing and training deep learning models to automate the classification and segmentation of waste images, which can aid in better waste sorting and recycling processes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is located in the following directories:
- Training data: `/content/drive/MyDrive/WASTE MANAGEMENT DATASET/TRAIN`
- Testing data: `/content/drive/MyDrive/WASTE MANAGEMENT DATASET/TEST`

Images are preprocessed using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) to enhance their quality before feeding them into the models.

## Models

### U-Net for Image Segmentation
U-Net is used for segmenting waste images. The architecture consists of an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections, allowing precise localization of segmented regions.

### InceptionV3 for Classification
InceptionV3 is a pre-trained model on ImageNet used for waste image classification. Custom layers are added on top of the base model for our specific classification task.

### ResNet50V2 for Classification
ResNet50V2, also pre-trained on ImageNet, is used with custom layers added on top for classification. The base model layers are frozen during training to leverage pre-trained features.

### Custom CNN
A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is built from scratch for waste image classification, consisting of several convolutional and max-pooling layers followed by fully connected layers.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/waste-management-image-segmentation-classification.git
   cd waste-management-image-segmentation-classification
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Mount Google Drive (if using Google Colab):
   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
   ```

## Training and Evaluation

### U-Net Segmentation

1. Define and compile the U-Net model.
2. Train the model using the training data generator.
3. Evaluate the model on the validation data generator.

### InceptionV3 Classification

1. Load the pre-trained InceptionV3 model without the top classification layer.
2. Add custom layers on top of the base model.
3. Train the model using the training data generator.
4. Evaluate the model on the validation data generator.

### ResNet50V2 Classification

1. Load the pre-trained ResNet50V2 model without the top classification layer.
2. Add custom layers on top of the base model.
3. Train the model using the training data generator.
4. Evaluate the model on the validation data generator.

### Custom CNN

1. Define the custom CNN architecture.
2. Train the model using the training data generator.
3. Evaluate the model on the validation data generator.

## Results

After training and evaluation, the models achieve various levels of accuracy on the validation and test datasets. Confusion matrices and classification reports are generated to assess the performance of the models.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of using deep learning models for waste management image segmentation and classification. By automating these processes, we can improve the efficiency of waste sorting and recycling systems.
